                <h1>One Little-Known Rule Has Many Drivers Ditching Their Insurance Company & Doing This Instead</h1>
                <img src="images/fon.jpg" alt="">
                <h3>Drivers - There's 1 simple rule that you probably don't know, and your auto insurance
                    company wants
                    to
                    keep it
                    thatway.
                </h3>
                <p>We all know insurance company agents are paid on commission. They will attempt to sell you
                    the highest
                    possible
                    rate
                    to round up their own paychecks, while conveniently leaving out this extremely beneficial
                    information.
                </p>
                <p class="discount">Unknown to many families, if you are currently insured and drive less than 50 miles
                    a
                    day, you can get an <a href="#">point2 - Quotza</a> on your auto coverage! What's more is
                    if
                    you
                    don't have any major driving violations, that discount will increase even more...

                <p>NEVER buy auto insurance without doing your due diligence by comparing rates and discounts available
                    from

                    Tip: Despite what your agent may say, you are NEVER locked into your current policy. Even if you've
                    already paid your bill, you still are eligible for a refund and may cancel at any time.
